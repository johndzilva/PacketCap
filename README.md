# üî• PackCap Tool

PackCap Tool is an advanced network and packet analysis tool designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts and network analysts. It provides a comprehensive set of features for capturing, analyzing, and managing network packets and Bluetooth HCI logs. Built with Python, Scapy, and PyShark, and featuring a stylish UI with Rich.

## üöÄ Key Features

PackCap Tool is packed with robust features designed to simplify and enhance network and packet analysis. Here‚Äôs what it offers:

- **Project Management:**
  - Create, manage, and organize multiple projects efficiently.
  - Dynamically create and select projects, with default settings tied to each project.
  - Auto-save captures and analysis results within the selected project directory.
  - Manage multiple projects with ease.
  - Create and select projects dynamically.
  - Default settings are tied to the selected project.
- **Network Packet Capture:**
  - Capture live network traffic across multiple interfaces with customizable filters.
  - Apply advanced filters by source IP, destination IP, protocol type, and custom ports.
  - Auto-generate filenames using UTC timestamps if no filename is provided.
  - Capture live network traffic with custom filters.
  - Save captures to project-specific directories.
  - Auto-generate filenames with UTC timestamps.
- **Trace File Analysis:**
  - Analyze PCAP and LOG files from project directories.
  - Extract detailed protocol distribution, top talkers, and packet statistics.
  - Resolve domain names for external IPs using DNS data from captured packets.
  - Analyze PCAP and LOG files within project directories.
  - Extract detailed protocol distribution and top talkers.
- **Flow Analysis:**
  - Group packets by flow, identifying unique sessions using source IP, destination IP, ports, and protocol.
  - Visualize flow statistics including packet counts, byte sizes, and bandwidth usage.
  - Identify suspicious flows or anomalies by comparing session patterns.
  - Group packets by flow (src IP, dst IP, src port, dst port, protocol).
  - Display flow statistics including packet counts and byte sizes.
- **Bluetooth HCI Log Analysis:**
  - Supports Bluetooth HCI logs exported from Android devices in both PCAP and LOG formats.
  - Detects encrypted packets, extracts Link Keys and Long Term Keys (LTK).
  - Group packets by sessions showing Source and Destination MAC addresses and Connection Handles.
  - Displays encryption status per session and pinpoints the packet numbers for key exchanges.
  - Supports Bluetooth HCI logs exported from Android.
  - Identifies encrypted packets and extracts Link Keys and Long Term Keys (LTK).
  - Groups packets by sessions, displaying MAC addresses and connection handles.

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python Packages:
  - scapy
  - pyshark
  - rich
  - netifaces (optional for detailed network info)
- TShark (for Bluetooth HCI log analysis)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

To get started with JDZ Tools, follow the steps below to install the required dependencies and set up the environment.

1. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install scapy pyshark rich netifaces
```

2. Install TShark:

- On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install tshark
```

- On macOS (Homebrew):

```bash
brew install wireshark
```

- On Windows: [Download from Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) and ensure TShark is added to PATH.

## üé¨ Getting Started

Launch tool using the command below and follow the on-screen instructions to select a project or create a new one, modify default settings, and perform network captures or analysis.

```bash
python3 jdz_tools.py
```

1. Select a project or create a new one.
2. Modify default settings as needed.
3. Capture network packets or analyze existing trace files.
4. Perform flow analysis or advanced Bluetooth HCI log analysis.

## üìö Practical Examples

Here are some practical examples to help you get started with JDZ Tools:

```bash
# Start PackCap Tools
python3 packcap.py

# Capture network packets and save to a project
- Select 'Capture Network Packets'
- Apply filters as needed (e.g., source IP, destination IP, protocol)
- File saved with UTC timestamp if no name is given

# Analyze Bluetooth HCI log
- Select 'Bluetooth Trace File Analysis'
- Choose a .log or .pcap file from the project folder
- View sessions, encryption status, and key details
```
